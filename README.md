Project Overview
The Facial Recognition Attendance System is an AI-powered desktop application that replaces manual attendance-taking with automated face recognition.
It identifies individuals from webcam input and marks attendance automatically in a database with date and time.
This solution is suitable for schools, colleges, offices, and research projects.
